**About**
As an **Admin User** I can **manage hire orders and stock levels** so that **inventory remains accurate and overselling is prevented**

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Given a hire order is successfully paid, stock quantities are reduced atomically.
- [ ] Then stock cannot drop below zero.
- [ ] Then I can view and update order statuses in the admin interface.
