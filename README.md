## Overview

PropHouse is a digital hire platform designed for production companies and creative teams to browse, hire, and manage prop and equipment orders online.

All products are available for direct hire through a standard e-commerce checkout flow. In addition, users may subscribe to an optional membership plan which provides discounted pricing on eligible products. Membership enhances value through pricing benefits rather than gated access.

The core journey of the application is:

**Browse → Add to Basket → Checkout → Hire**

The platform is built using Django with a relational database and Stripe (test mode) for payment processing. It follows an accessibility-first, mobile-first approach aligned to WCAG 2.1 AA and the Code Institute Level 5 specification.

Wireframes were created to plan layout and interaction patterns before development, focusing on:

- Clear product imagery hierarchy.
- Transparent pricing display.
- Distinct basket summary section.
- Clear separation between membership pricing and standard pricing.
- Minimal friction checkout process.

| Page           | Wireframe    |

# Database Design

## Overview

The database uses a relational schema designed to support product hire, transactional integrity, and subscription logic.

Stock quantity is authoritative at the Product model level. Basket operations do not decrement database stock; stock is only decremented during successful paid checkout using atomic transactions and row-level locking.

## Core Models

- User
- Product
- Category
- Order
- OrderItem
- Address
- Membership
- Subscription

---

# Architecture

## High-Level Overview

- Django templates for server-side rendering.
- Django ORM for relational data modelling.
- Stripe test API for payments and subscriptions.
- Modular apps aligned to domain boundaries.

## App Structure

- core (static pages, base templates)
- accounts (authentication, dashboard)
- profiles (addresses, wishlist if implemented)
- catalogue (products, categories)
- commerce (basket, checkout, orders, subscription logic)

## Security & Best Practice

- Environment variables for secrets.
- CSRF protection enabled.
- DEBUG disabled in production.
- Stripe webhooks validated.
- Atomic transactions used during checkout.

---

# Development & Code Style

## Git Commits

Conventional Commits format used for clear and structured history.

## Python

- PEP 8 compliant.
- Business logic separated into appropriate layers.
- Defensive validation of all user input.

## JavaScript

- Used for progressive enhancement only.
- No critical dependency on JS for core flows.

## HTML

- Semantic structure enforced.
- Accessible markup with ARIA where appropriate.

## CSS (BEM Methodology)

- Modular, predictable class naming.
- Clear separation of layout and component styles.
